# Mazag√£o FrontEnd

This is an old private project I created to track points for a Minecraft server I used to play on with my friends.



## Features

- Tracking of enemy player kills
- Tracking of natural block mining
- Server authentication system (login and registration)



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
